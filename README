    1) anagramMain - think of this as your "application", i.e. no 
                     testing code will be included or referenced.

    2) anagramTest - this project contains your test cases, and test
                     data. Has refs to anagramLib, and gtest

    3) anagramLib - this project contains the functions that are tested
                    using gtest, and called from your main() 
                    application
